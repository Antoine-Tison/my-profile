                 I play rugby since I was three years old and it's my passion. I also love travelling and I had the chance to travel a lot thanks to my parents and the fact that I used  to live in Hong-Kong for six years.

               <h2>Rugby</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about rugby. I practice this sport since I was three years old. This sport is my principal passion and I have long wanted to be a proffesionnal player. I started this sport because my parents pushed me to go to the trainings and I realised that I loved this sport. I started rugby in Hong-Kong for six years and then I continued in France when I arrived in 2012. I was playing in a great team which is called Stade Francais Paris. I just changed team this year to ally my passion to my studies. I have three trainings per week and I still love this sport after sixteen years of practicing.

               <h2>Travelling</h2>
    <p>
              Since I was young, I had the chance to travel a lot. I lived six years in Hong-Kong so I could discover lots of new countries I didn't know. I visited all Oceania and almost all Asia because Hong Kong is nearby. Today, when I tell my friends I had the chance to visit Australia, they are amazed and jealous. But in fact it's just like if I was living in France and visiting Italy.

               <h2>Hong-Kong</h2>
    <p>
               I used to live in Hong-Kong from my one to seven years old. I remember this period a lot even if i was really young. Hong-Kong is a little island just on the East side of China. The climate was very different from France because it was tropical. I loved this city because we could find huge towers and just next to it, an enormous tropical jungle. I think it was a chance to live over there because I could discover lots of things like new cultures or new landscapes. Today, I live in France and I love it too but I couldn't say whichone I prefer.
